## Lazy tests 

 This project presents five concepts to improve your unit tests.
  
  **Concepts:**
1. BDD Statement 
     > Structure used to improve description and separate the configuration, execution and evaluation blocks.

2. Json Inside scenario file
     > Strategy used to separate structure from logic.

3. Wiremock inside scenario file
     > Changing DSL to Json Wiremock, this one allows you to remove structure from logic and makes the tests cleaner and more readable. 

4. Match snapshot
     > Adhering to the model created by Jest JS, developed by Facebook, this concept makes tests easier to develop, eliminating the need for manual matching.
      

5. Custom Comparator for dynamic fields
     > Configuring the snapshot lib to support dynamic fields(like a DB ids, date etc).
